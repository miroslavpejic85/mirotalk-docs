## Custom integration

Let's refine and organize the steps for integrating MiroTalk into existing platforms like `Perfex, PlayTube, Sngine, Wowonder`, or other web applications in a more polished manner:

### Initial Setup:

1. `Define Integration Point:`
   In your existing application, identify where you want to integrate the video conferencing feature. This could be within a specific module or page.

2. `HTML Button:`
   Create a button element in the HTML of your chosen page to serve as the trigger for starting a video conference session.

```html
<button id="startConferenceButton">Start Video Conference></button>
```

PHP Version:

```html
<!-- Your HTML form -->
<form method="post">
  <button type="submit" name="startConferenceButton" id="startConferenceButton">
    Start Conference>
  </button>
</form>
```

3. `JavaScript or PHP Function:`
   Use JavaScript or PHP to handle the button click event, opening a new window or tab for the video conference.

JavaScript:

```javascript
document
  .getElementById("startConferenceButton")
  .addEventListener("click", function () {
    window.open("videoConference.html", "_blank");
  });
```

PHP:

```php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
 if (isset($_POST['startConferenceButton'])) {
  echo '<script> window.open("videoConference.html", "_blank"); </script>';
 }
}
```

### Video Conference HTML Page:

Create a dedicated HTML page, named `videoConference.html`, to host the video conferencing functionality.

```html
<!-- videoConference.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- HTML container for the video conference -->
    <iframe
      allow="camera; microphone; display-capture; fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write; autoplay"
      src="https://sfu.mirotalk.com/newroom"
      style="height: 100vh; width: 100vw; border: 0px;"
    ></iframe>
  </body>

  <!--
    The iframe 'src' attribute can be any of:
      - https://sfu.mirotalk.com
      - https://p2p.mirotalk.com
      - https://c2c.mirotalk.com
      - https://bro.mirotalk.com
      - https://webrtc.mirotalk.com
      - ...
	-->
</html>
```

After setting up your MiroTalk instances, please update the `src` attribute with your custom domain or subdomain name.
