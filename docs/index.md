## Quick custom integration

Refine and organize the steps for integrating MiroTalk into your existing application. Identify the specific module or page where you intend to integrate the video conferencing feature. This integration can be implemented into existing platforms such as `Perfex, PlayTube, Sngine, Wowonder`, or other web applications.

#### HTML Button:

Create a button element in the HTML of your chosen page to serve as the trigger for starting a video conference session.

```html
<!-- Button for Javascript -->

<button id="startConferenceButton">Start Video Conference></button>

<!-- Button for PHP-->

<form method="post">
  <button type="submit" name="startConferenceButton" id="startConferenceButton">
    Start Conference>
  </button>
</form>
```

#### JavaScript or PHP Function:

Use JavaScript or PHP to handle the button click event, opening a new window or tab for the video conference.

JavaScript button click event:

```javascript
document
  .getElementById("startConferenceButton")
  .addEventListener("click", function () {
    window.open("videoConference.html", "_blank");
    // toggleMiroTalk();
  });
```

PHP button click event:

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
 if (isset($_POST['startConferenceButton'])) {
  echo '<script> window.open("videoConference.html", "_blank"); </script>';
  // echo '<script> toggleMiroTalk(); </script>';
 }
}
```

#### Video Conference HTML Page:

Create a dedicated HTML page, named `videoConference.html`, to host the video conferencing functionality.

```html
<!-- videoConference.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- HTML container for the video conference -->
    <iframe
      id="mirotalkIframe"
      allow="camera; microphone; display-capture; fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write; autoplay"
      src="https://sfu.mirotalk.com/newroom"
      style="height: 100vh; width: 100vw; border: 0px;"
    ></iframe>
  </body>

  <!--
    The iframe 'src' attribute can be any of:
      - https://sfu.mirotalk.com
      - https://p2p.mirotalk.com
      - https://c2c.mirotalk.com
      - https://bro.mirotalk.com
      - https://webrtc.mirotalk.com
      - ...
	-->
</html>
```

Another approach is to embed the iframe within your current website or application page and control its visibility through toggling.

```javascript
function toggleMiroTalk() {
  const mirotalkIframe = document.getElementById("mirotalkIframe");
  mirotalkIframe.style.display =
    mirotalkIframe.style.display === "none" ||
    mirotalkIframe.style.display === ""
      ? "block"
      : "none";
}
```

After setting up your MiroTalk instances, please update the `src` attribute with your custom `domain` or `subdomain name`.

#### Customize your iframe scr attribute:

You can customize the URL for the `src` attribute using query parameters, as explained in the "join-room" section for each MiroTalk variant:

- [MiroTalk SFU direct join](./mirotalk-sfu/join-room.md)
- [MiroTalk P2P direct join](./mirotalk-p2p/join-room.md)
- [MiroTalk C2C direct join](./mirotalk-c2c/join-room.md)
- [MiroTalk BRO direct join](./mirotalk-bro/join-room.md)

Additionally, you have the option to generate the URL through our RestAPI:

- [MiroTalk SFU REST API](./mirotalk-sfu/api.md)
- [MiroTalk P2P REST API](./mirotalk-p2p/api.md)
