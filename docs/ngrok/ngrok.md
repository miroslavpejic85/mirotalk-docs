Ngrok is a popular and widely used software tool that provides a secure tunneling service, allowing you to expose your local development server, typically running on your computer, to the internet. It creates a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to a locally running web service or application, which can be helpful for various purposes, including:

1. Development and Testing: Developers often use Ngrok to test web applications or APIs in a development environment. It allows them to share their work with colleagues or clients without deploying it to a public server.

2. Debugging: Ngrok is useful for debugging web applications because it allows external access to a locally hosted application, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

3. Demos and Showcases: Ngrok is handy for showcasing a work-in-progress application or website to stakeholders who are not on the same local network.

4. Webhooks Testing: It's often used for testing and debugging webhooks by providing a publicly accessible URL for third-party services to send data to.

5. IoT Device Testing: Ngrok can be used to remotely access and control IoT (Internet of Things) devices running on local networks.
