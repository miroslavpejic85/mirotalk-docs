# Rebranding

!!! warning "License Required"

Rebranding requires at least a üëâ **[Regular License](https://codecanyon.net/item/mirotalk-p2p-webrtc-realtime-video-conferences/38376661)**, available on CodeCanyon.

---

There are two ways to rebrand MiroTalk P2P:

1. **From `config.js` file** with `htmlInjection` enabled (recommended)

---

## Landing Page

```js
    brand: {
        app: {
            title: '<h1>MiroTalk</h1>Free browser based Real-time video calls.<br />Simple, Secure, Fast.',
            description:
                'Start your next video call with a single click. No download, plug-in, or login is required. Just get straight to talking, messaging, and sharing your screen.',
            joinDescription: 'Pick a room name.<br />How about this one?',
            joinButtonLabel: 'JOIN ROOM',
            joinLastLabel: 'Your recent room:',
        },
				//...
		}
    //...
```

You can also hide optional landing page sections:

```js
	brand: {
		//...
		html: {
			topSponsors: false,
			features: false,
			browsers: false,
			teams: false,
			tryEasier: false,
			poweredBy: false,
			sponsors: false,
			advertisers: false,
			footer: false,
		},
		//...
	}
```

## New Room Page

![p2p-new](../images/p2p/newcall.png)

```js
brand: {
	//...
	site: {
			newCallRoomTitle: 'Pick name. <br />Share URL. <br />Start conference.',
			newCallRoomDescription:
					"Each room has its disposable URL. Just pick a room name and share your custom URL. It's that easy.",
	}
	//...
}
```

2. **By modifying the HTML files** with `htmlInjection` disabled

In this approach, brand injection is disabled and you can fully customize the project for your needs. The frontend files are located in the `app/public/views` folder.

## Reference

The full config configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk/blob/master/app/src/config.template.js)

## Updates

When you update to the newest version of MiroTalk SFU using the `./p2pUpdate.sh` script, any customized files (such as your branding in public/views) get overwritten. This happens because the update process replaces the entire base code and can‚Äôt automatically preserve client-specific modifications.

So after each update, you‚Äôll need to reapply your own branding files unless they‚Äôre separated from the tracked source code and also if there are changes in the `.env - config.js` file need to update it as well accordingly.

Here are a few recommended options to handle this more smoothly:

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Use `git stash` before updating

If your changes are small (like branding or a few layout edits), you can use:

```bash
cd mirotalk
git stash push -m "My branding changes"
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose pull
docker image prune -f
docker-compose up -d
git stash pop
```

This saves your local edits, updates the base code, and then reapplies your customizations.
If any merge conflicts appear, you can resolve them manually.

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Create a dedicated `‚Äúcustom-branding‚Äù branch`

For more extensive or ongoing custom work, it‚Äôs better to create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b custom-branding
```

Commit all your modifications there.
When a new version is released:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout custom-branding
git merge main
```

This lets you merge updates from the main repo into your custom branch while keeping your branding intact.

### ‚úÖ Option 3: Mount your branding via `Docker volumes`

If you‚Äôre deploying with Docker Compose, you can keep your branding outside the repo and mount it into the container:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./custom/views:/app/public/views
```
This way, updates won‚Äôt touch your custom files, they‚Äôll stay completely separate from the update process.

In short:

* `Small edits`: use git stash.
* `Ongoing customizations`: use a custom-branding branch.
* `Docker deployment`: mount your branding as volumes.

This will make future updates much smoother and prevent your branding from being overwritten.
